# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets

  Our aim for this project is to find apps that are attractive to users and hence identify the type of apps that will generate the most revenue. As data analysts in a company that builds Android and iOs mobile apps, we help our developers to make data driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they make.
  This is a data science project that analysizes scraped app data from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store . You check them from [this page](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and here as [well](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps).
